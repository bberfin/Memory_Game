RULES :
> The game begins with showing each digit of a 5 digit number in turn.

> Then the 'guess' button appears and the user enters the value.

> If the guess is correct, a new pattern with 1 more than the previous pattern is created. Thus, our number will have 6 digits.

> The user guesses again and if it is correct, a new pattern with 1 more 
than the previous pattern ( 7 digits will be created) is created and the 
loop continues indefinitely. 

> The user can exit the game by pressing the -1 key.

without entering anything , a message box appears on the screen with an 
error message about entering numbers only.
